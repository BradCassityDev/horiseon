# Code Refactor Starter Code

## HORISEON Refactor Project

## Overview:
Refactor the starter code to adhere to current HTML and CSS standards. By modifying the supplied files in the provided repository, I have made adjustments to both the index.html and sytle.css files to follow a semantic strucutre that has also allowed me to consolidate css declorations to cover a overlapping styles among elements. Comments have been included in both files to ease future maintance of said files.
